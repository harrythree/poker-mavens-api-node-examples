# Poker Mavens - API Examples using Node.js, Express and Handlebars

The original examples from the Poker Mavens docs are all written in PHP, but I thought it would be helpful to have a version written in Node.js/JavaScript.

I tried to stick as close to the original examples as possible, including leaving in comments. Obviously it can not be an exact match to the original code but it is close.

## Setup

### Environment Variables
Copy the `.env-example` file and rename it to `.env`. Fill in the variables for your Poker Mavens Server. As a security best practice `.env` files are not included in source code. More information can be found at [12factor.net/config](https://12factor.net/config).

### NPM

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
